## Hi, I`m David ☕👨‍💻
-----------------------

### 🤖 Who am I? 

I've discovered programming when I was a kid, specifically, when I read Language C - Luis Damas at the age of 13. Until now, I remember my first Hello Word, my first PCB, and my first game - Snake, of course! Oh, I almost forgot of Betina - the first follow-line-robot I ever built. With Betina, I won 4 Brazilian Robotics Olympiads.

In short, I am passionate about technology. I see computing as art, software as the soul of hardware. Therefore, I use technology not only in a professional way but also to help my daily life. Since 2016, I have been dedicating a part of my time to develop assistive technologies, that is, technologies to help people with visual impairments. I became interested in this topic after realizing that there are few tools to include blind people in society.

Anyway, in the last few years, I have been studying clean code, a scrum method to make my code more accessible and clean. Therefore, if you want to know what I've been working on, check out my repositories.
